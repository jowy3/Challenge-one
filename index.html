            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
                 It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment 
                 (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                  objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                
               <p> JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
                    Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators,
                     control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a 
                     variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
                <ul><li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to
                     control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side 
                     extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond
                      to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant
                     to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an 
                     application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from 
                     one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li></ul>
